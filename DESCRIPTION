Description: The package Ringo simplifies the analysis of two-color oligonucleotide microarrays from NimbleGen, which for example can be used in ChIP-chip projects. The package employs functions from various other packages of the Bioconductor project and provides additional NimbleGen-specific and ChIP-chip-specific functionalities. Its mainly covered subjects are data read-in, quality control, visualisation and identification of genomic regions showing enrichment in ChIP-chip. Please take note that Ringo is geared towards two-color NimbleGen microarrays. For single-channel NimbleGen arrays, we recommend the package 'oligo'.
