Description: The package Ringo facilitates the primary analysis
   of ChIP-chip data. The main functionalities of the package are
   data read-in, quality assessment, data visualisation and
   identification of genomic regions showing enrichment in ChIP-chip.
   The package has functions to deal with two-color oligonucleotide
   microarrays from NimbleGen used in ChIP-chip projects, but also
   contains more general functions for ChIP-chip data analysis, given
   that the data is supplied as RGList (raw)  or ExpressionSet (pre-
   processed).
   The package employs functions from various other packages of the
   Bioconductor project and provides additional ChIP-chip-specific
   and NimbleGen-specific functionalities.
